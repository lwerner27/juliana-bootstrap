                            For generations, Sybaline Shaw’s family has lived in
                            an enchanted valley in the Appalachian Mountains,
                            using their magic to help grow the land. But now the
                            government has built a dam that will force the Shaws
                            to relocate, and they’re running out of time before
                            their home will be flooded. Syabline and her cousin
                            Nettle can’t imagine life without the valley and its
                            magic, so they do the one thing they can do: they
                            stay. Using magic, they build an invisible wall
                            around their home. As the water rises, they learn a
                            terrible truth: the water will continue to rise,
                            leaving them to live beneath the lake itself. There
                            is also a consequence to using magic selfishly, one
                            that might transform both her and Nettle forever. If
                            she can’t find a way to escape, Sybaline and the
                            ones she loves could be trapped in the valley
                            forever. From the author of The Wolf of Cape Fen
                            comes a beautiful and lyrical story about one family
                            with magic in their bones, and what happens when we
                            have to give up what we love most.
